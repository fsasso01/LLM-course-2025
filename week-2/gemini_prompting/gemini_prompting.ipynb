            "    *   **Zero-Shot CoT:** Adding \"Let's think step by step.\"\n",
            "    *   **Manual CoT:** Providing CoT examples in a few-shot manner.\n",

            "6.  **Tree-of-Thought (ToT):** Extending CoT by exploring multiple reasoning paths (a tree structure) at each step, allowing for backtracking and re-evaluation.\n",

            "9.  **Persona Prompting:** Assigning a specific role or persona to the model (e.g., \"You are a senior data scientist...\") to influence its tone, style, and perspective.\n",
